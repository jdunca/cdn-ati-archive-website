### Accessing government information can be tricky. We want to make it easier.

<font size = 4> Every year journalists, academics, lawyers, and members of the public file tens of thousands of requests for information from the Canadian Government. But previously filed Access to Information (ATI) requests aren't made public by default. That's why we are working to develop the Canadian ATI Archive.

Currently, you can find summaries of previously completed requests on Canada's [Open Government website](https://open.canada.ca/en/search/ati). If you find one you want, you can fill out a web form requesting access. If you want more than one, you have to complete the form multiple times. Usually, information is released on a CD or USB key as a PDF image that doesn't support text searching or copy and paste functions.

We published hundreds of previously filed ATI requests that go back as far as 2014 through [Pinpoint](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/collections&utm_source=caij), a Google tool that uses artificial intelligence and advanced information retrieval techniques to identify text in the PDF files and help investigators quickly search through huge amounts of content.

Right now our collection features files from the [Department of Justice](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/search?collection=545b02bfc4d44314&utm_source=caij), the [Canada Border Services Agency](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/search?collection=a2fd1411cad7fb36&utm_source=caij), and the [Canada Security Intelligence Service](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/search?collection=b2c31ff7297a47f7&utm_source=caij). We will continue expanding the number of documents available in the coming months.

It's often helpful to see the wording of the original request. Unfortunately, completed summaries are only kept in the public dataset for two years. Our mirror of the public dataset updates weekly and features summaries going back to 2017. You can [download](https://github.com/lchski/gc-ati-summaries-data/blob/main/ati-summaries.csv) the whole dataset or [search](https://gc-ati-summaries-data.labs.lucascherkewski.com/summaries/summaries) through it using this SQL query builder.
